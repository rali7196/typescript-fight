This is my submission to Last Call Media for the prompt: Write a fight between two typescript functions. This is a sorting algorithm comparison that compares merge sort and bubble sort. 

# Running the code locally

## Compatibility

This software was only tested on Ubuntu 22.04, so it might not work on Windows. However, there is a good chance it will work on MacOS

## Setup
First, set up node version manager (if you don't know how, read this [link](https://codedamn.com/news/nodejs/nvm-setup-guide) and install version 22.14 with this command:

```
nvm install 22.14
nvm use 22.14
```

Then, run start.sh with the following command, and in your browser navigate to localhost:5173

```
bash start.sh
```
